# WeatherForecastApp

- Run app on any device or simulator iOS 14 or above from XCode and accept tracking locations while using app
- I implemented the MVVM-C architecture
- I encountered challenges trying to test my async methods in unit tests
- I also had challenges setting up the model for the weather data because it was so much data
- I used dependency inversion to handle my Network calls for my ViewModels
